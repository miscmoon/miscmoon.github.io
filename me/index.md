Welcome to my little galaxy of thoughts, miscmoon:crescent_moon:. Here youâ€™ll find miscellaneous writings within the general realms of psychology, technology and digital culture, as well as obscure stories from the past.

I am a psychologist who writes and I am many things - inquisitive, boundless, and alive, among others. When I am not writing or working towards my MSc, I can usually be found reading some form of literature with a damn good cup of coffee in hand.
