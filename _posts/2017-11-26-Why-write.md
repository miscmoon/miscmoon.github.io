When I was around nine my idea of a great weekend involved having my parents take me to the bookshop so I could peruse the children’s section. I’d pick up something from The Babysitter’s Club and any other book that caught my attention as I largely based my selections on the covers. As soon as we’d get home I’d choose a book and read until the sun went down, so engrossed in the words that getting up to turn on a light was too disruptive a task to carry out. I’d moved from Spain only a year earlier, and I have no doubt that my reading obsession had a big part to play in my learning English. I began keeping a journal where I recorded the very important things that go on in a nine-year-old’s life, in a language that wasn’t my own. My thought processes now incorporated this borrowed language, through which I was framing my world. Soon, the reading and writing were really an extension of each other. The more I read, the better I was able to express my ideas.

Nearly 20 years later I am sat here writing about why I write, borrowing from [George Orwell](http://orwell.ru/library/essays/wiw/english/e_wiw). But I am not a writer. I am only immensely curious, and it has remained that the best way for me to make sense of my experiences, both external and otherwise, is through writing. I write to think. I write to bring ideas down to words; to pull everything apart and reconstruct the remains as I learn; to express what results; to document and remember. Underlying this all is clearly an impulse to create and transform what is already there.

I have been writing online since the early 00s. I’ve not kept a record of it all, so I am starting from scratch here on miscmoon.com until whatever comes after the internet finally gets here.
