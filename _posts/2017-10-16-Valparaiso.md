Yesterday Camila and I headed into Valpara√≠so for a bookbinding workshop. As we pulled into the station the air was humid and Valpo's typical sea mist hung from the sky. I was glad to have brought my jacket as it was chilly at first.

We had lunch, went up and around into all sorts of shops and corners. The workshop itself was a fun though short experience. We dipped into a bit of serigraphy (not my strength it seems, though it takes practice) to make our own covers before sewing the inner pages together. I'll probably never be able to bring myself to actually use it. There was a book fair going on right next door so I also managed to get my hand on some indie published books.

As always the sun ended up pouring down and my jacket then became more of a burden. We had churros by the docks before walking across the city back to the station. It's nice to get away from Santiago and the smog from time to time; it was a Sunday very well spent.

I am now sat trying to get some studying done, but I just quickly wanted to jot down what I'd been up to before I forgot. And I tend to forget to remember these things.
