It is 2:54a.m.; I am sat at the dining room table because we're having the upstairs renovated and so the study has ceased to be for now. Unfortunately my procrastinating tendencies have yet again caught up with me, so here I am, catching up on last week's reading and preparing to start off the next conference on Saturday.

Back in Chile, J's sleeping patterns kept me in check. Up by 8a.m., in bed by 11p.m. I haven't had a healthier sleeping schedule in years. In FL now, left to my night-owl ways I sit alone, doing everything I had no energy to do during the day, as everyone else sleeps. This isn't fun for a few reasons:

- In my attempts to be extremely quiet I end up being anything but.
- I sleep well into the next day.
- Consequently I am useless for the rest of the next day,
- until my brain finally wakes up at around midnight.

Somehow this is how I concentrate best, so until I have to be socially functional, I see no real harm...
