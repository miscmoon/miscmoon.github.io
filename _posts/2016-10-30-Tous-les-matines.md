Day 3. I've been terrible. Enjoying my time alone (completely alone) and not. But mostly because there is nobody to hold me accountable, I've been finding it extremely hard to self regulate. My days are open and it's so much easier to sit on the kitchen counter, close enough to snacks and right in front of the TV.

Despite mounting work and all the reading I'm so blatantly ignoring, I'm taking a trip up to NYC on the first week of November. Looking forward to not having to drive everywhere, even just for a few days.
