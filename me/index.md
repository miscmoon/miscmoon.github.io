title:  The human behind the blog
---

I am a psychologist who writes and I am many things - sensitive, observing, and alive - among others.

Born in Madrid, Spain, I grew up in several different countries, an only child and lover of books. Sometime after having our first computer set up back in ’94 I fell in love with the machine and have been tinkering with one pretty much ever since. I have been blogging since early 2000, although of the many reincarnations of what was my first ever blog, I’ve not kept a single entry. I regret this deeply, especially surfing around, seeing old places I used to frequent dating back to 2001 or earlier. Miscmoon is an attempt to keep a log of what I read, what I watch and where I go. A commonplace book of sorts, where I write in-depth essays and miscellaneous notes on the universe of things that interest me.

I am currently based in Santiago, Chile. I am a perpetual learner, moved by the quotidian, patterns, and obscure stories from the past. When not working, I can usually be found reading some form of literature with a damn good cup of coffee in hand.
